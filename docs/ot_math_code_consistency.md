# OT math ↔ code ↔ Lean consistency map

Maps every optimal-transport (measure-coupling) math statement in `paper/main.tex` (equation/label) to
its code implementation (`file::function`) and, where one exists, its machine-checked Lean lemma. Built
for loop 1 of the OT-reframing campaign; every row was checked against the cited source. Numbers are the
authoritative verified set (never altered).

Scope: `solvers/contact/measure_coupling/` (`coupling.py`, `gap_field.py`, `traction.py`, `assembly.py`,
`two_body.py`), the two-body drivers under `benchmarks/contact/cv_numerical/`, and the mathlib-free Lean
project under `lean/`. Manuscript path: `paper/main.tex` (Sec. 4 `sec:tmap`, Appendix B `app:ot`).

## Status: CONSISTENT (re-verified loop 9; CV-8 multi-realization ensemble disclosure + reproducibility hygiene — the headline 2.75%/5.82% stays the labeled single-realization gate, now EVIDENCED by a five-seed ensemble; no headline number altered; the loop-8 coherence state below is unchanged)

Loop-9 delta (CV-8 ensemble disclosure + reproducibility, additive — the headline 2.75%/5.82% is unchanged and re-derived exactly; `tectonic main.tex` exits 0, 0 undefined references/citations, 0 multiply-defined labels):
- **Framing (judge consensus, 3 panels):** KEEP `2.75%`/`5.82%` (mesh seed 7) as the labeled single-realization headline gate; carry the five-seed ensemble alongside; do NOT substitute the ensemble mean. The cherry-picking concern is neutralized by *disclosure* (label seed 7 as best-of-five, report mean±sd and range), not substitution. Honesty enforced everywhere: seed 7 is the **best of five on BOTH metrics** (`a` 2.75% = min; `p_0` 5.82% = low end of the band); only the `p_0` floor is called realization-robust, the half-width is explicitly realization-dependent.
- **Measured ensemble (nx=192, R=2.0, δ=0.02, n_load=6, graded mesh, jitter 0.03; mesh seeds 7/11/17/23/31; all force balances ~1e-18..1e-19), re-run this loop and matching the prior values EXACTLY:** `a_relerr` {2.75, 3.52, 4.30, 3.71, 3.09}% → mean **3.47%**, population sd **0.53%** (sample sd 0.59%), range [2.75, 4.30]% — realization-DEPENDENT; `p0_relerr` {5.82, 5.96, 6.00, 6.02, 5.90}% → mean **5.94%**, population sd **0.07%** (sample sd 0.08%), range [5.82, 6.02]% — realization-INDEPENDENT (genuine plane-strain CST + finite-penalty systematic floor). sd convention disclosed as population (ddof=0) in the table/figure captions.
- **Manuscript edits (all additive, headline numbers preserved):** new `\paragraph{Ensemble disclosure across realisations.}` + `tab:cv8-ensemble` + `fig:cv8-ensemble` in `sec:ex_twobody` (l.2058–2114); headline-table caption/rows labeled best-of-five-on-both-metrics + ensemble (`tab:twobody:headline`, l.2145–2158); abstract (l.134–136 and l.379–381), conclusion (l.2890–2891), `fig:ot_advantage` caption (l.2297–2298), `rem:ot-verdict` floor sentence (l.2322–2326), the in-section "single-realisation" caveat (l.2179–2180 now points to the ensemble), and the appendix prose + `tab:ot:gates` caption (l.3612–3615, l.3625–3629). Every pre-existing residual caveat (~3–6% contact-edge floor, single-realisation/now-evidenced, plane-strain CST small-strain, frictionless, rigid outer walls in CV-9a) is PRESERVED, not deleted.
- **Reproducibility hygiene (judge required-fix):** the five non-headline values previously lived only hardcoded in the figure generator. Now `cv8_deformable_ot.py` threads `mesh_seed` through `hertz_test`→`hertz_convergence` to the curved-block `block_mesh(..., seed=mesh_seed)`, adds a `--mesh-seed` CLI flag and a `--mode ensemble` sweep (`hertz_ensemble(seeds=...)`) that writes `runs/cv8_deformable_ot/ensemble.json` (per-seed `a/p0_relerr`, force balance, and population+sample sd stats); `postprocessing/fig_cv8_ensemble.py` now READS that JSON (committed-fallback to the same MEASURED arrays if `runs/` is absent, since it is gitignored). A referee regenerates the ensemble with `python3 benchmarks/contact/cv_numerical/cv8_deformable_ot.py --mode ensemble` — no source edit. The default `cv8_deformable_ot.py` gate run is unchanged (seed 7).

Loop-8 delta (manuscript-side, additive — no verified number altered; `tectonic main.tex` exits 0, 0 undefined references/citations, 0 multiply-defined labels):
- **Item 1 — abstract parenthetical reordered** (l.142): `(Cattaneo stick radius, Hertz half-width)` → `(Hertz half-width, Cattaneo stick radius)`. The adjacent conventional range `1.59\%`--`11.15\%` is Hertz-then-Cattaneo (Table `tab:ot_vs_conv` l.2197 Hertz `a`=1.59%, l.2198 Cattaneo `c/a`=11.15%; contributions bullet l.391 pairs Cattaneo with 11.15%); the parenthetical was reversed, inverting the value→benchmark mapping in the abstract. Reorder aligns it with the nearer conventional list. No number moved.
- **Item 2 — undefined acronym expanded** (l.2224, Fig. `fig:ot_advantage` caption): `symmetric SPSD four-block mortar tangent` → `symmetric positive-semidefinite four-block mortar tangent`. "SPSD" occurred exactly once and was never expanded; "symmetric positive-semidefinite" is the house form used throughout. ("symmetric SPSD" was also redundant — the S already means symmetric.)
- **Item 3 — CST defined at first use** (l.2115): `plane-strain CST small-strain` → `plane-strain constant-strain-triangulation (CST) small-strain`. The expansion previously appeared only later (l.3042); the three later "CST" instances (l.2256, 2766, 3548) are left as-is.
- **Item 4 — orphan float closed** (Appendix A, acceptance-tolerance sentence ~l.2942): appended `(these acceptance tolerances are collected in Table~\ref{tab:closedforms})`. `tab:closedforms` carried a `\label` (l.3143) but had zero `\ref` anywhere; it is now cited exactly where the tolerances it consolidates are introduced.
- Item 5 (retarget the friction-plateau cross-reference at l.3942 from `sec:discr` to `sec:disc:limits`) was REJECTED by both judges — the current `sec:discr` target is defensible (the plateau is named there) and the "discussed there" anchor ties the reference to the cited section; left as-is.

`tectonic main.tex` exits 0 with 0 undefined references/citations and 0 multiply-defined labels (re-run this loop, loop 7; `grep -icE 'undefined (reference|citation)' main.log` = 0, `grep -icE 'multiply.defined' main.log` = 0; no rerun/labels-changed warning; the regenerated `cv8_hertz_convergence_pub.png` loads from `../figures/`). The loop-6 state below is otherwise unchanged: `grep -ci undefined
main.log` = 0; labels `eq:ot-kantorovich-body`/`eq:ot-cyclical-body` (body), `eq:ot-kantorovich`/`eq:ot-cyclical`
(appendix proof home), `eq:ot-unbalanced` (Fig 37/page 51, co-located with the new schematic Eq 82),
`fig:ot-coupling`, `fig:ot-unbalanced` (loop-6 NEW), `sec:ot`/`sec:tmap:ot`, and the
`TranslationInvariance` footnote cross-references all resolve in `main.aux`; no duplicate `\label`). `cd lean &&
lake build` exits 0 (mathlib-free, packages `[]`, 9 jobs); the cited algebraic theorems are sorry-free and depend
only on `propext`/`Quot.sound` (verified by `#print axioms` this loop, including the loop-3 `MortarMass.lean` SPD
set `posdef`, `scaled_posdef`, `eigen_three`, `eigen_one`, `det_pos`, the OT-6 patch-test extension
`patch_test_resultant`, `constant_pressure_master_reaction`, `constant_pressure_balance_point`, and the **new
`TranslationInvariance.lean` set `patch_resultant_list`, `tangent_translation_null`,
`rigid_translation_gap_invariant`, `foot_resultant_zero`, `rigid_translation_balanced` — all `[propext,
Quot.sound]`**); only the two `*_proposed` Brenier theorems carry `sorryAx` (build emits exactly the two expected
`sorry` warnings at `BrenierProposed.lean:93,113`) and are labelled "proposed, not machine-checked" in the paper.
No math/code mismatch found.

Loop-4 delta (manuscript-side, additive — no verified number altered):
- **Two core OT equations PROMOTED into the main-body OT subsection** (EQ1/EQ2/X1; `sec:tmap:ot`, after
  `eq:ot-monge-body`): the convex **Kantorovich relaxation** `eq:ot-kantorovich-body` (inf over plans
  `π∈Π(μ̂_A,μ̂_B)` with the prescribed marginals) and **c-cyclical monotonicity** `eq:ot-cyclical-body`
  (`Σ c(x_i,y_i) ≤ Σ c(x_i,y_{σ(i)})` ∀σ), with the tightness statement (a.c. slave marginal ⇒ plan on a graph ⇒
  Monge=Kantorovich) and the reduction to correspondence monotonicity `(τ(x_1)−τ(x_2))·(x_1−x_2)≥0`. This makes
  the existence chain Monge→(infeasible)→Kantorovich→cyclical-monotone→Brenier self-contained in the body; the
  body now `\eqref`s the two `-body` labels and the closing-sentence pointer (`sec:tmap:ot`, formerly l.975) is
  reframed from "the Kantorovich relaxation … in Appendix" to "stated here … their measure-theoretic existence and
  pushforward proof … are given in Appendix~`app:ot`". The appendix copies `eq:ot-kantorovich`/`eq:ot-cyclical`
  (proof home) are KEPT — they carry the appendix's own internal `\eqref`s (l.3280, 3282, 3345, 3354) and the
  detailed tightness/Brenier flow — so this is a PROMOTE with distinct labels, not a move (no appendix `\ref`
  breaks; no duplicate `\label`). HONESTY: c-cyclical monotonicity is scoped to the **conforming** Brenier map
  (no-crossing order-preservation); the body block ties it to `eq:ot-brenier-1d-body`, and the appendix prose
  states it is the structure the partial-support restriction *forfeits*, **not** the cause of the partial-load
  smearing — per the applied-math judge's note. No code object (these are measure-theoretic existence statements,
  like the `*_proposed` Brenier theorems); not in Lean.
- **Spine threaded to the body OT subsection** (`sec:tmap:ot`, which a prior loop created but left referenced from
  nowhere): organisation paragraph (P2), contributions item 1 (P3), examples-intro two-body (P4), `sec:ex_twobody`
  detector opener (P5), and discussion opener (P6) now name `Section~\ref{sec:tmap:ot}`; the organisation
  paragraph recasts `app:ot` from "develops in full" to "supplies the measure-theoretic backbone of
  Section~\ref{sec:tmap:ot}". No equation moved — the `-body` display copies and the canonical `app:ot` copies
  both stay (the panel rejected the move-not-duplicate label churn).
- **Repro Lean list completed** (`app:repro`, TEX-2): the machine-checked-module enumeration now lists all SIX
  modules — PartitionOfUnity, MortarMass, TangentPSD, **TranslationInvariance** (loop-4 NEW), RadialSign,
  BrenierProposed — matching the body footnotes (`eq:ot-mortar-mass-body` l.954, the `app:ot:tangent`
  rigid-translation footnote l.3458) and the actual `lean/OTContact/` directory.
- **Measure-coupling hero schematic added** to `sec:disc:ot` (`fig:ot-coupling`,
  `\includegraphics{fig_ot_section_loop4}`): the (a) two densities + mass-preserving χ, (b) quantile-matched
  Brenier map, (c) two-limits schematic the existing figures omit. Number-free (caption: "Schematic; no benchmark
  quantity is plotted"). The figure script `postprocessing/fig_ot_section_loop4.py` builds `τ=F̂_B⁻¹∘F̂_A` by the
  same arclength-CDF construction `MonotoneCoupling1D` uses (`_Fs1=Fs/Fs[-1]`, max|F̂_B(τ)−F̂_A|=1.1e-16).
- **OT-MATH-2 normalisation fix (Brenier display + propagated to EVERY symbol site).** The appendix display
  `eq:ot-brenier-1d` (l.3273) and the body display `eq:ot-brenier-1d-body` (l.902) both carry the normalised
  `τ=F̂_B⁻¹∘F̂_A` with `F̂_X=F_X/F_X(θ_max)` and `F̂_B(τ(θ_A))=F̂_A(θ_A)`, matching the code
  (`coupling.py::MonotoneCoupling1D`, `_Fs1=Fs/Fs[-1]`, `_Fm1=Fm/Fm[-1]`). The false "both sides scale by the same
  total mass" parenthetical is GONE, replaced by the correct admissibility argument (the unnormalised composition
  would query `F_B⁻¹` at a quantile up to `F_A(θ_max)` outside `F_B`'s range; the renormalisation by the in general
  unequal totals `F_A(θ_max)≠F_B(θ_max)` is what makes `χ_#μ̂_A=μ̂_B` admissible). This loop the `F̂` convention
  was made UNIFORM across all eight Brenier-map symbol sites: abstract (l.125), `fig:tm-ot-limits` node label +
  caption (l.1905, 1925), CV-5 conforming-limit prose (l.2240), `fig:ot-coupling` caption (l.2606-2608),
  `sec:disc:ot` prose (l.2622), and the appendix display + two-limits + `rem:ot-limits` (l.3269, 3273, 3316, 3336).
  The only remaining bare `F_B⁻¹` (l.3279) is deliberate — it is the explanatory clause stating WHAT goes wrong
  WITHOUT normalisation. Type-row in §1 updated.
- **OT-MATH-1 type-consistency fix (conforming-regime potential).** `app:ot:gap` (l.3292-3306) no longer claims
  `f=½‖x‖²−φ` is simultaneously a 1-D scalar potential on `Γ_c^A` and satisfies the `R²` gradient identity
  `∇f(x)=x−τ(x)`. It now states the Brenier gradient is the PARAMETER-space map `τ=φ'` (monotone, conservative, no
  circulation), and routes the physical-gap energy-consistency to the matched-normal property `∇_x g_N=n` of
  Remark `prop:matched-normal` (already proven; `RadialSign.lean`). No `g_N=∂_n f` claim remains. §1 `eq:ot-gap`
  row updated to reflect the parameter-space-gradient / physical-gap split.
- **OT-LEAN-3 rigid-translation invariance machine-checked (NEW module `TranslationInvariance.lean`).** The
  `app:ot:tangent` claim was tightened from the imprecise "master row-sum of `K_ms` vanishes" (false in isolation:
  `Σ_J K_ms[K,J]=−ε Σ_q w_q J (N_K⁻∘χ)(n⊗n)≠0`) to "the COMBINED slave–master gap variation vanishes under a
  uniform translation, `Σ_I N_I⁺=Σ_K(N_K⁻∘χ)=1`, so `ε(Σ N_I⁺−Σ N_K⁻∘χ)=0` and the net contact force is null."
  Three theorems now certify this sorry-free: `tangent_translation_null` (`ε d+(−(ε((d−k)+k)))=0`),
  `rigid_translation_gap_invariant` (`d−((d−k)+k)=0`), and `patch_resultant_list` (the patch resultant of
  `prop:patch` summed over the FULL Gauss-foot list, by list induction, not one foot). §4 + §7 Lean-citation map
  updated (now SIX modules).
- **Two-limits ordering harmonised.** Body `eq:ot-twolimits-body` (l.918) and appendix `eq:ot-twolimits` (l.3333)
  now both list the arclength-monotone (conforming) branch FIRST, then the closest-point (partial-support) branch —
  resolving the prior body-vs-appendix ordering mismatch. No content change.

Loop-3 delta (manuscript-side, additive — no verified number altered):
- **Spectral-bias measurement wired in.** New figure `fig:spectral-bias`
  (`\includegraphics{fig_spectral_bias_pub}`, Sec.~`sec:cv7-headline`) replaces the previously asserted
  "spectral bias" sentence with the MEASURED Welch-PSD comparison produced by
  `postprocessing/fig_spectral_bias.py`. Measured values printed by that script and quoted in the prose/caption:
  asperity band `[1, 14.2]` cyc/mm; chart never rolls off (retains 100% / +0.0 dB of band power); plain MLP
  rolls off at 0.33 cyc/mm (0.027% / −35.7 dB); ambient SDF at 0.25 cyc/mm (0.019% / −37.2 dB); built-in
  honesty gate `chart_wins=True`. The figure's chart uses `n_freq=128` (82,562 params), labelled in the caption
  as DISTINCT from the `n_freq=64` capstone, so the 82k vs 66k counts are never conflated.
- **Parameter-count audit table added** (`tab:capacity-audit`, after Remark `cor:capacity` in Sec.~`sec:fourier`).
  Trainable counts instantiated from the code (`scratchpad/count_params.py`; Fourier bank `freqs` is a
  non-trainable registered buffer, excluded): Fourier height chart `n_freq=64` = 66,178; ambient SDF depth-6 =
  83,073; plain-MLP ablation = 49,922. The SDF carries 25.5% MORE trainable params than the chart and still
  reconstructs 47× worse — the chart's win is capacity-matched-or-better, not bought with parameters. The
  plain-MLP row carries a footnote: it is the width/depth/optimizer-matched encoding-off ablation, NOT a
  total-param-matched comparison (the Fourier encoding necessarily widens the first layer).
- **Two OT rigor one-liners** (minimal, additive) in `app:ot:gap` / Remark `rem:ot-limits`: (1) the
  closest-point = restricted-OT-map claim now carries its well-posedness hypotheses (convex master ⇒ single-valued
  metric projection off the medial axis, `\citep[\S1.3]{santambrogio2015optimal}`; single-valued slave graph
  `z=h_A(x)`) and the partial-transport `\citep{chizat2018unbalanced}` cite; (2) `eq:ot-gap` now states `φ`/`f`
  are scalar potentials on the 1-D slave parameter line `Γ_c^A`, not fields on the ambient `R²`. Point (3)
  (`π_B` not a.e. a gradient across the medial axis) was already present at `app:ot:gap` and was NOT touched.
  All cited bib keys (`santambrogio2015optimal`, `chizat2018unbalanced`) pre-exist in `refs.bib`.

Loop-1 code-side delta: `solvers/contact/measure_coupling/two_body.py` PATCH TEST docstring (l.29-40) was
corrected (OT-3) to stop equating the P1 partition of unity with the OT mass marginal — it now reads "DISTINCT
FROM, and downstream of, the OT mass marginal `chi_# mu_A = mu_B`", matching the manuscript wording at
`app:ot:discrete` and the abstract/intro/discussion. The docstring also now points at the machine-checked
Lean precondition (`patch_test_resultant`).

| `eq:ot-gap` | `g_N=(x−τ(x))·n`; conforming branch: Brenier gradient is the PARAMETER-space map `τ=φ'` (monotone, conservative, no circulation), NOT an `R²` gradient of `f`; the physical-gap energy consistency is the matched-normal property `∇_x g_N=n` (Rem `prop:matched-normal`) | `gap_field.py::GapField.sample` (`d=Xs−Xm`, `gN=(d·ns)`); `two_body.py` (`gN=(xs−xmaster)@n_hat`) | `RadialSign.*` (matched-normal sign/magnitude) | yes — OT-MATH-1 (loop 4): dropped the type-inconsistent `g_N=∂_n f` / `∇f(x)=x−τ∈R²` claim; `τ=φ'` is the 1-D param-space gradient, physical-gap conservativeness via `prop:matched-normal` |
| `eq:ot-gap` (true normal, unbiased) | `n_s=(−h',1)/√(1+h'²)`; no 1/cosα bias | `gap_field.py` (`ns=[-hp/sec,1/sec]`); `two_body.py::assemble_two_body_contact` (`ns`) | `RadialSign.*` (separates magnitude bias from sign) | yes — unbiased normal (`math_verification.md` C2) |

## 2. The two admissible regimes (`app:ot:limits`, Remark `rem:ot-limits`)

| Paper (eq/label) | Statement | Code (`file::symbol`) | Lean | Consistent? |

## 3. The discrete coupling is a mortar assembly (`app:ot:discrete`)

| Paper (eq/label) | Statement | Code (`file::symbol`) | Lean lemma | Consistent? |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `eq:ot-marginal` | host weights partition of unity `Σ_K(N_K⁻∘χ)=1` — PoU, **not** the OT mass marginal | `two_body.py::_locate_master` (returns `(j,1−t,t)`, sum≡1); `coupling.py::ClosestPointCoupling1D.map_full` (`N0=1−t,N1=t`) | `PartitionOfUnity.p1_host_weights`, `marginal_two_host` (sorry-free) | yes — OT-3/P1: relabelled PoU at all ~10 paper sites + the `two_body.py` docstring (loop 1); paper now states "where the foot lands" (measure preservation) vs "how the reaction is split" (PoU, what the patch test exercises) |

## 4. The symmetric four-block tangent (`app:ot:tangent`, Proposition `prop:spsd`)

| Paper (eq/label) | Statement | Code (`file::symbol`) | Lean lemma | Consistent? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `eq:ot-gapvar` | frozen-geometry variation: drop **both** `∂n` and `∂χ` (`∂(N_K⁻∘χ)/∂u`) | `two_body.py` docstring l.11-14 ("drop the geometric d(n) term"); self-test 2 `resid_frozen` freezes `n_hat` AND `(N_K∘χ)` | — | yes — OT-P2: paper now states both dropped terms, matching `resid_frozen` |

| `tab:ot:gates` (symbolic `dR/du`, FD `df/du`) | 64 entries exact; FD 3.45e-11 — **on the frozen-geometry residual** | `two_body.py` self-test 2 (FD vs `resid_frozen`, rel<1e-6 → 3.45e-11); self-test 3 (closest-point) | — | yes — table footnote scopes both gates to the frozen residual (OT-P7) |

## 5. Verified two-body / N-body results (`app:ot:results`, `sec:ex_twobody`)

| Paper claim | Value | Source | Consistent? |
|---|---|---|---|
| CV-8 deformable Hertz `a` (nx 24→192, the GATE) | 5.14→4.14→2.96→**2.75%** | `cv8_deformable_ot.py`, `runs/cv8_deformable_ot/metrics.json`; `final_report.md` §7 | yes — headline gate, untouched |
| CV-8 `a` finer mesh (nx 224/256/288, loop 7) | 1.79→3.19→4.03% (jitters in the ~1.8–4% contact-edge floor band; NOT monotone past the gate; finest mesh is the worst) | `CV8_CONV_FINER` in `postprocessing/plot_two_body_ot.py::fig_hertz` (production regime R=2.0, δ=0.02, n_load=6, graded mesh, jitter 0.03; force balances ~1e-18..1e-19) | yes — finer points added as DATA only; no monotone-convergence claim past nx=192 |
| CV-8 `p_0` (nx 24→192) | 6.34→5.68→5.91→**5.82%** (plateau ~5.8%) | same as gate row | yes — headline gate, untouched |
| CV-8 `p_0` finer mesh (nx 224/256/288, loop 7) | 5.31→5.70→5.99% (clean interior plateau, still near 5.8%) | `CV8_CONV_FINER` | yes |
| CV-8 `a` ENSEMBLE (nx 192, seeds 7/11/17/23/31, loop 9) | {2.75, 3.52, 4.30, 3.71, 3.09}% → mean **3.47%**, pop. sd **0.53%**, range [2.75, 4.30]% (realization-DEPENDENT; gate seed 7 = best = 2.75%) | `cv8_deformable_ot.py --mode ensemble` → `runs/cv8_deformable_ot/ensemble.json`; `fig_cv8_ensemble.py`, `tab:cv8-ensemble`/`fig:cv8-ensemble` | yes — headline 2.75% labeled best-of-five; ensemble disclosed alongside |
| CV-8 `p_0` ENSEMBLE (nx 192, same seeds, loop 9) | {5.82, 5.96, 6.00, 6.02, 5.90}% → mean **5.94%**, pop. sd **0.07%**, range [5.82, 6.02]% (realization-INDEPENDENT systematic floor; gate seed 7 = low end = 5.82%) | same as `a` ensemble row | yes — `p_0` floor is realization-robust (sd 0.07%); headline 5.82% labeled low end |
| CV-8 patch test / force balance | 1.4e-16 / 1.27e-19 | same | yes |
| CV-9a centre mean stress / anisotropy (D4) / force balance | 0.58% / 0.20–0.22% / 3.71e-15 | `cv9_nbody_array_ot.py`; `tests/test_cv9_nbody_ot.py` | yes |

| OT-vs-conventional head-to-head (CV-1..7) | 1.59→0.50 (3.2×), 11.15→0.03 (370×), 1.62→0.23 (6.3×), 0.11→0.077 (1.4×), 1.99e-2→5.3e-13, frozen→2.6e-16, 1.5e-4→3.5e-14 | `final_report.md` §1 Table 1 | yes — `tab:ot_vs_conv` + `fig:ot_advantage` (P1, FIG-OT-ADV-1) |

## 6. Honest residuals / caveats carried in the paper (unchanged)

- CV-8 ~3–6% `a`/`p_0` is contact-edge noise (∞ Hertz edge slope over one element; `p_0` plateaus ~5.8%, a floor). Stated in `sec:ex_twobody`, `tab:ot:gates` caption, abstract (N8 parenthetical), and `sec:verif_summary` closing paragraph (P9). **Loop 7 EVIDENCES the floor** (no longer asserted from the 24→192 sweep alone): extending the surface resolution past the nx=192 gate, `a_relerr` does not fall below 2.75% but jitters 1.79→3.19→4.03% across nx=224/256/288 — bouncing inside the ~1.8–4% band, with the two finest meshes no better than the gate and nx=288 the worst, which a genuine convergence rate could never produce. The interior `p_0` plateaus cleanly over the same sweep (5.31→5.70→5.99%, near 5.8%). The honest reading is a discrete contact-edge floor of `O(1/nx_edge)` amplitude (the recovered edge shifts by `O(1)` surface node over the infinite Hertz edge slope), NOT a convergence-rate error finer meshes remove, and NOT instability. New text appended to the `sec:ex_twobody` CV-8 paragraph (`main.tex` l.2044–2052) + the finer sweep plotted in the `fig:cv8-hertz` inset (`CV8_CONV_FINER`, shaded "contact-edge floor" `axhspan` over nx≥192, gate marker at nx=192). Headline 2.75%/5.82% (nx=192) unchanged.
- Both two-body solves report **single-realization gate values**, plane-strain CST small-strain, frictionless, rigid outer walls (CV-9a). Stated in the same places + `sec:disc:limits`. **Loop 9 EVIDENCES the single-realization caveat at the CV-8 headline mesh** with a five-seed ensemble (seeds 7/11/17/23/31, nx=192): the `a`-spread (~0.5% pop. sd) is the contact-edge floor made visible — the reported 2.75% is the *best* of five (ensemble mean 3.47%, still inside the stated ~3–6% band) — while `p_0` is realization-robust at 5.94±0.07% (pop. sd 0.07%), confirming the ~5.8% plateau is a genuine CST + finite-penalty systematic, not a lucky seed. The headline seed 7 is best-of-five on BOTH metrics (`a` 2.75% = min; `p_0` 5.82% = low end), disclosed as such in `sec:ex_twobody`, `tab:cv8-ensemble`, the headline/appendix tables, abstract, and conclusion. CV-9a remains single-realization (no ensemble run).
- Brazilian/nine-disc conventional baselines are prescribed-load (Neumann-exact); the OT win there is structural (emergent load, recovered half-width/symmetry), not a like-for-like stress win. Stated in `tab:ot_vs_conv` caption, the nine-disc callout (P5), and `final_report.md` §6.
- Dropped geometric tangent (`∂n`, `∂χ`) is a Newton-path lever only; the converged `a_fem` is tangent-independent (identical at 40 vs 120 iters; `math_verification.md` §R2). Stated in `app:ot:tangent` and `sec:disc:limits`.
- Cattaneo 370× and Hertz 3.2× are reported as same-mesh (Cattaneo on the converged n=3200 mesh; both conventional and OT from `final_report.md` Table 1). The 5–11% Cattaneo figure in `sec:ex_cattaneo` is the coarse-mesh L1-vs-closed-form number and is explicitly distinguished from the converged 0.03%.

## Loop-6 delta (substantive-refinement pass; manuscript-side only, no verified number altered, no equation moved)

Structure and equation-completeness are SATURATED (the dedicated top-level OT section `sec:ot`/`sec:tmap`
exists with the full body equation chain; the appendix `app:ot` carries the measure-theoretic proofs and the
`eq:ot-unbalanced` functional). Loop 6 made exactly two manuscript edits plus one consistency-map row:

- **Introduction two-limits dedup + ordering harmonised** (`sec:intro`, l.158-162). The intro previously
  stated the two limits TWICE — once conforming-first then again closest-point-first (flipped) — with a
  redundant restatement. Collapsed to a single "two familiar limits of one coupling" sentence ordered
  **arclength-monotone/conforming FIRST, closest-point/partial-support SECOND**, matching the abstract
  (l.124), the body `eq:ot-twolimits-body` (l.943-944), and the appendix `eq:ot-twolimits` (l.3395-3396).
  All four sites now order conforming→partial identically. No new equation; pure prose harmonisation.
- **Partial-OT schematic `fig:ot-unbalanced`** inserted in `app:ot:limits` after `rem:ot-limits` (Fig 37,
  page 51, beside `eq:ot-unbalanced` = Eq 82). Illustrates the balanced-map smearing failure mode and the
  medial-axis multivaluedness — content NOT in the two existing OT figures (`fig:ot-coupling`,
  `fig:tm-ot-limits`). Honest: schematic, no benchmark quantity plotted, closest-point feet/gap computed
  analytically with a self-check `g_N==‖p−c‖−R` to 0.0 (`postprocessing/fig_ot_section_loop6.py`).
  Referenced once from `rem:ot-limits`; no body cross-reference added (kept the saturated body subsection
  state-and-cite intact).

Audited-and-left-unchanged this loop (verified already-present / measured, per the HARD RULE — Read the live
target before proposing; do not re-propose live text):

- **Partial-OT functional** (item 1): `eq:ot-unbalanced` (KL-relaxed Kantorovich) + the off-medial-axis
  single-valuedness argument are STATED in full in `app:ot:limits`/`rem:ot-limits` (l.3354-3369) and
  state-and-cited in the body `sec:tmap:ot` (l.952-958). No re-derivation needed; the body forward-references
  the appendix equation rather than duplicating it.
- **ML/capacity/spectral** (item 2): MEASURED, not asserted. Chart `n_freq=64` = 66,178 params; plain-MLP
  ablation = 49,922; ambient SDF = 83,073 (25.5% surplus); spectral-figure chart `n_freq=128` = 82,562,
  matched to the SDF's 83,073 — the `fig:spectral-bias` caption (l.2453-2457) states this matched-capacity
  fact so the roll-off separation is charged to the representation, not a capacity edge. `n_freq=128-vs-64`
  disambiguation intact; no implied equal-capacity where there is none.
- **Newton-path lever** (item 3): the dropped `d(n)/d(χ)` frozen-geometry terms are framed as a
  convergence-rate lever (NOT an accuracy lever) at every occurrence (`sec:weak`, `sec:disc:limits`
  "identical `a_fem` at 40 and 120 iterations", `app:ot:tangent`, `app:repro`); none claims they can move the
  converged CV-8 2.75%/5.82% accuracy.
- **Lean** (item e): `lake build` exits 0 in this worktree with exactly the two documented `BrenierProposed`
  sorries (`brenier_existence_uniqueness_proposed`, `monotone_map_pushes_forward_proposed`), both labelled
  "proposed, not machine-checked" and never cited as proven; all other cited theorems sorry-free. No new
  load-bearing algebraic claim was introduced by loop 6, so no Lean extension was required.
