## Overview

Solving PDEs on geometries as complex as a Stanford rabbit interior, a torus, or a
three-dimensional star domain is challenging for classical mesh-based methods because
mesh generation is expensive and mesh quality is hard to control. This codebase takes a
**fully meshfree** approach:

1. The geometry is represented implicitly by a learned **Signed Distance Function (SDF)**.
2. The SDF is used to construct a set of overlapping **coordinate charts** (a smooth atlas)
   that together cover the entire domain.
3. On each chart, a small PINN — either a dense MLP or a spatially-localized
   **CompactChartNet** (Voronoi sub-atlas) — solves a local version of the PDE in
   chart-local coordinates.
4. The local solvers are coupled through a **multiplicative Schwarz alternating procedure**
   that enforces value and normal-derivative continuity across chart boundaries.

**Key capabilities**

## Mathematical Formulation

### 1. Domain and SDF Representation

Let **Ω ⊂ ℝ³** be the physical domain with boundary **∂Ω**. The geometry is
represented by a neural Signed Distance Function:

```
SDF_θ : ℝ³ → ℝ,   SDF_θ(x) < 0 ⟺ x ∈ Ω,   SDF_θ(x) = 0 ⟺ x ∈ ∂Ω
```

The SDF network is trained to satisfy the **Eikonal equation** with surface and normal
constraints:

```
‖∇ SDF_θ(x)‖ = 1                    (eikonal)
SDF_θ(x_s)   = 0  for x_s ∈ ∂Ω     (surface constraint)
∇ SDF_θ(x_s) = n_s                  (normal alignment)
```

Coordinates are normalized so that the bounding box of Ω maps to ≈ [−0.55, 0.55]³.

---

### 2. Coordinate Charts and Atlas

We cover Ω with **N overlapping coordinate charts** {(Ω_i, φ_i)}_{i=1}^N. Each chart consists of:

- **Chart seed** `s_i ∈ ∂Ω` — a surface point that anchors the chart
- **Support ball** `Ω_i = B(s_i, r_i) ∩ Ω` — the subdomain associated with chart *i*
- **Support radius** `r_i` — chosen so that the N balls achieve ≥99% coverage with ~20% overlap
- **Chart coordinate space** `ξ ∈ B̄(0, r_i) ⊂ ℝ³` — the local parameter domain

**Atlas construction** uses **Poisson-disk sampling** to place N seeds on ∂Ω with mutual
separation ≥ d_min, then assigns support radii to ensure full volumetric coverage:

```
Seeds: {s_i}_{i=1}^N ⊂ ∂Ω,   ‖s_i − s_j‖ ≥ d_min for all i ≠ j
Neighbors: 𝒩(i) = { j ≠ i : B(s_i, r_i) ∩ B(s_j, r_j) ≠ ∅ }
```

---

### 3. Chart Decoder and TNB Frame

Each seed `s_i` carries a local **Tangent-Normal-Binormal (TNB) frame**:

```
t₁ᵢ, t₂ᵢ  — tangent vectors at s_i (computed from SDF gradient)
nᵢ         — inward surface normal = −∇SDF_θ(s_i) / ‖∇SDF_θ(s_i)‖
Fᵢ = [t₁ᵢ | t₂ᵢ | nᵢ]  — orthonormal frame matrix (3×3)
```

The **chart decoder** φ_i maps local chart coordinates ξ ∈ ℝ³ to physical space x ∈ ℝ³:

```
φᵢ(ξ) = sᵢ  +  Fᵢ · ξ  +  Δφᵢ(ξ)
```

where `Δφᵢ` is a small nonlinear correction learned by a MLP with amplitude
`≈ 0.20 · tanh(raw_scale) · rᵢ ≈ 0.08` in normalized coordinates.
The Jacobian `Jᵢ(ξ) = ∂φᵢ/∂ξ ∈ ℝ^{3×3}` is used for coordinate transformations.

---

### 4. PDE Pullback to Chart Coordinates

The **Poisson equation** on Ω:

```
−Δₓ u(x) = f(x),    x ∈ Ω
u(x)       = g(x),    x ∈ ∂Ω
```

is pulled back to local chart coordinates via the chain rule.
Let **Jᵢ = ∂φᵢ/∂ξ** be the 3×3 Jacobian. Then the Laplacian transforms as:

```
Δₓ u = Σⱼₖ aⱼₖ(ξ) · ∂²u/∂ξⱼ∂ξₖ  +  lower-order terms

where the metric tensor is:  a(ξ) = |det Jᵢ| · (Jᵢ⁻ᵀ Jᵢ⁻¹)
```

The PDE residual in chart coordinates is:

```
R_pde(ξ) = Δₓ u_net(ξ) + f(φᵢ(ξ))
```

**Jacobian inversion** uses `torch.linalg.inv` (LU decomposition) in the backward pass
for numerical stability. SVD is reserved for condition-number diagnostics under
`torch.no_grad()` to avoid gradient instability when singular values coincide.

---

### 5. Direct-Coordinate Mode (TNB)

Since the TNB frame `Fᵢ` is **orthonormal** (det Jᵢ = 1, condition number κ = 1 for the
rigid part), the Laplacian simplifies exactly when the decoder residual Δφᵢ is dropped:

```
Δₓ u = Σⱼ ∂²u/∂ξⱼ²          (exact for orthogonal frames)
```

Enabled with `--direct-coord-pde`. This eliminates all Jacobian issues and permits
isolating the Schwarz convergence from decoder quality. All training and evaluation in
the Schwarz Poisson experiments (W1–W5, CompactChartNet) use this mode.

---

### 6. Multiplicative Schwarz Decomposition

The Schwarz method decomposes the global problem into local sub-problems on each
subdomain Ω_i, coupled through interface conditions on overlapping regions:

**Interface value continuity** (Robin-penalty):
```
L_iv(i,j) = E_{x ∈ Ω_i ∩ Ω_j} [ (uᵢ(ξᵢ(x)) − uⱼ(ξⱼ(x)))² ]
```

**Interface flux continuity** (normal-derivative matching):
```
L_if(i,j) = E_{x ∈ Ω_i ∩ Ω_j} [ (∇uᵢ · nᵢⱼ − ∇uⱼ · nᵢⱼ)² ]
```

**Multiplicative Schwarz sweep**: charts are updated sequentially (or in graph-colored
groups). At iteration `k`, chart i's PINN is retrained with all neighbor solutions
`{u_j}_{j ∈ 𝒩(i)}` held fixed:

```
uᵢᵏ⁺¹ = argmin_{uᵢ} [ Lᵢ(uᵢ; {uⱼᵏ}_{j ∈ 𝒩(i)}) ]    for i = 1, …, N
```

A **trust-region filter** rejects Schwarz updates that increase the global rel_l2 error
beyond a threshold; the learning rate is halved on rejection.

**Plateau detection** (W3): the stale counter increments when `rel_l2_eval` does not
improve by more than `plateau_tol`; training stops when `stale ≥ plateau_patience`.

---

### 7. Multi-Objective PINN Loss

On each chart *i* the total loss at Schwarz iteration *k* is:

```
Lᵢ  =  w_pde · L_pde  +  w_bc · L_bc  +  w_sup · L_sup
     +  w_iv  · Σⱼ∈𝒩(i) L_iv(i,j)
     +  w_if  · Σⱼ∈𝒩(i) L_if(i,j)
     +  w_h1  · Σⱼ∈𝒩(i) L_h1(i,j)
```

| Term | Expression | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| **L_pde** | `E_ξ[ (Δₓuᵢ + f)² ]` | PDE residual over interior points |
| **L_bc** | `E_ξ[ (uᵢ(ξ_bc) − g(x_bc))² ]` | Dirichlet boundary condition |
| **L_sup** | `E_ξ[ (uᵢ(ξ) − u*(φ_rig(ξ)))² ]` | Manufactured-solution anchor (W2) |
| **L_iv** | `E_{Ω_i∩Ω_j}[ (uᵢ − uⱼ)² ]` | Interface value continuity |
| **L_if** | `E_{Ω_i∩Ω_j}[ (∂_n uᵢ − ∂_n uⱼ)² ]` | Interface flux continuity |
| **L_h1** | `E_{B_i∩B_j,vol}[ (uᵢ − uⱼ)² ]` | Volumetric H1 overlap penalty (W5) |

**Recommended weights** (validated in attempt19_w4):
`w_pde=5, w_bc=1, w_sup=0.5, w_iv=2, w_if=2, w_h1=0.5`

**PDE warmup**: `w_pde` is ramped from 0 to its target value over `pde_warmup_iters`
Schwarz iterations to allow boundary conditions to settle first.

---

### 8. PCGrad Gradient Surgery

When L_pde and L_sup have **conflicting gradients** (dot product < 0), naïve combined
minimization makes one objective worse. **PCGrad** (K=2) resolves this per-chart:

```
For each parameter θ:
  g_pde ← ∇_θ (w_pde · L_pde)       # backward pass 1
  g_sup ← ∇_θ (w_sup · L_sup)       # backward pass 2
  g_oth ← ∇_θ (L_bc + L_iv + L_if + L_h1)  # backward pass 3

  # Symmetric projection when conflicting:
  if g_pde · g_sup < 0:
    g_pde ← g_pde − (g_pde·g_sup / ‖g_sup‖²) · g_sup
    g_sup ← g_sup − (g_sup·g_pde_orig / ‖g_pde_orig‖²) · g_pde_orig

  θ.grad ← g_pde + g_sup + g_oth
```

PCGrad requires 3 backward passes per local step (vs 1 for the combined loss) but
enables simultaneous progress on both the PDE and supervision objectives, reducing
Schwarz oscillation amplitude. Enabled with `--use-pcgrad`.

---

### 9. CompactChartNet — Voronoi Sub-Atlas

Instead of a single dense MLP per chart, **CompactChartNet** uses M=9 small Tanh-MLPs
whose outputs are blended by a **softmax partition-of-unity (POU)**:

```
u_chart(ξ) = Σ_{m=0}^{M-1} φₘ(ξ) · uₘ(ξ − sₘ)

φₘ(ξ)  = softmax_m( −‖ξ − sₘ‖² / 2τ² )       # POU weights (C∞)

τ = τ_scale × r_i                               # POU bandwidth
sₘ  — sub-seed positions in local frame:
       s₀ = 0  (chart centre)
       s₁…s₈ = ±r_i/3 cube corners (8 vertices)
uₘ  — small Tanh MLP:  ℝ³ → ℝ,  width=32,  depth=2
```

**Key properties**:
- Smooth (C∞) everywhere → autograd Laplacian well-defined
- Spatially localized → gradients of `uₘ` concentrated near sub-seed `sₘ`
- Parameter count: 10,953 per chart vs 12,801 for the dense MLP (width=64, depth=4)
- **Critical hyper-parameter**: τ_scale must be ≥ 0.5 for full chart coverage;
  τ_scale=0.125 (τ ≈ 0.051) leaves isolated Gaussian neighbourhoods → pretrain diverges

**Monotone convergence property**: spatial localization means local PDE updates disturb
neighboring charts less than a dense MLP, yielding monotone Schwarz descent over 60
iterations vs oscillation with the dense MLP.

---

### 10. Chart-Partitioned SDF

The global SDF uses a single **anchor offset** δ for sign-anchor supervision across the
entire domain.  For geometries with thin features (Stanford Bunny ears ~5 mm), a single
offset forces a trade-off: small δ gives poor interior coverage, large δ places anchors
outside thin features → wrong signs → corrupted interface normals.

**Chart-partitioned SDF** resolves this by training N **local** SDF networks `{φᵢ}`, one
per atlas chart, each with a **geometry-adaptive offset**:

```
offset_i = f_factor × dist(seed_i, nearest surface point)
```

For the Stanford Bunny with f_factor=0.30 this gives:
- Ear-region charts: offset ≈ 0.2–1.8 mm (within ear thickness)
- Body charts: offset ≈ 4–15 mm (deep interior coverage)

vs the global offset of 38.9 mm that places anchors outside all thin features.

**Training procedure** (implemented in `core/train_sdf_chartwise.py`):

1. **Voxel SDT initialization** — for each chart i, compute the exact unsigned distance
   from a local query grid to the nearest PLY surface point via `cKDTree`.  Sign is
   determined by the outward-normal dot-product test:
   `sign(q) = +1 if (q - p_nearest) · n_nearest ≥ 0 else -1`.
   The local `SDFNetLocal` is pre-trained by MSE regression to this SDT.

2. **Eikonal reinitialization fine-tuning** — the Eikonal loss `mean((‖∇φᵢ‖ - 1)²)` is
   the steady-state form of the governing equation of the reinitialization PDE:
   `∂φ/∂t + sign(φ₀)(‖∇φ‖ - 1) = 0`.
   The zero level set is preserved by the surface loss `|φᵢ(x_s)|`.

3. **Partition-of-unity blending** for inference — the global SDF is reconstructed as:
   ```
   φ(x) = Σᵢ wᵢ(x) φᵢ(x) / Σᵢ wᵢ(x),   wᵢ(x) = exp(-‖x-seedᵢ‖²/2σᵢ²)
   ```
   This is smooth and fully differentiable through PyTorch autograd.

4. **Global adapter** — a single `SDFNet(128/6)` is optionally fitted to the blended
   chartwise SDF via regression (`--fit-adapter`), providing a drop-in replacement for
   the existing atlas builder and PINN code with no modifications required.

        L_sign    ← softplus loss at x_s ± offset_i × n_s # adaptive sign anchor

        L_i = w_surf·L_surface + w_eik·L_eikonal + w_norm·L_normal + w_sign·L_sign

## Numerical Examples

### Example 1: Forward Poisson — 3D Ellipsoid / Star Domain

**Description**: Baseline verification of the mapped Poisson operator in two
simply connected settings. The ellipsoid uses an analytic global map, while the
star-domain case uses a learned global map.

**Domain**: 3D ellipsoid `x²/a² + y²/b² + z²/c² ≤ 1` (a=1.2, b=0.9, c=0.7);
3D star domain with 5-pointed star cross-section.

**PDE**:
- Ellipsoid: quadratic manufactured solution in reference coordinates
- Star domain: `u*(x) = sin(πx₁)sin(πx₂)sin(πx₃)`, RHS `f = 3π²u*`

**Method**: Single MLP PINN, sphere-mapping coordinate chart, no Schwarz coupling.

**Results**:

| Domain | Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 3D Ellipsoid | rel_L2 | `2.26e-3` |
| 3D Ellipsoid | max error | `5.23e-3` |
| 3D Star domain | rel_L2 | `2.59e-1` |
| 3D Star domain | max error | `5.06e-1` |

### Example 2: Forward Poisson — Stanford Rabbit (Schwarz)

**Description**: Flagship field-solve benchmark for the atlas-based SA-PINN
workflow. The Poisson equation is solved on the Stanford rabbit interior using a
fixed 12-chart volumetric atlas, chart-local neural fields, and Schwarz-style
overlap coupling.

**Domain**: Stanford rabbit volumetric interior, SDF-normalized coordinates ≈ [−0.55, 0.55]³.
Atlas: 12 interior ball-charts, support radius r ≈ 0.41, ~20% overlap, 100% coverage.

**PDE**: `−Δu = 3π² sin(πx₁)sin(πx₂)sin(πx₃)` with Dirichlet BC `u = 0` on ∂Ω.
Evaluation: `rel_l2 = ‖u_PINN − u*‖₂ / ‖u*‖₂` over 50K interior reference points.

**Validated solver improvements**:

| ID | Improvement | Effect |
|----|------------|--------|
| W1 | Consistent PDE operator in eval (TNB-frame Laplacian) | 28× speedup, −14% rel_l2 |
| W2 | Manufactured-solution anchor during Schwarz (`w_sup=0.5`) | −14.4% rel_l2 vs W1 |
| W3 | Plateau detection tracks rel_l2 (not composite score) | Correct stale counter |
| W4 | PCGrad K=2 gradient surgery (L_pde vs L_sup) | **−18.8% rel_l2 vs W3** |
| W5 | Stronger coupling (`w_if=2.0`, H1 volumetric overlap) | max_error −36%, uniformity ↑ |

**Canonical run**: `attempt20c_compact`

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| rel_l2 | **2.207%** |
| absolute L2 | `8.57e-3` |
| max_error | `6.783%` |
| mean_interface_residual | `1.979e-3` |
| final interface flux | `1.16e-2` |
| Runtime | `3659 s` |

**Performance tradeoff note**:

| Run | Architecture / Features | rel_l2 | max_error | Runtime |
|-----|------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| `attempt19_w4` | Dense MLP + W1–W5 | 2.531% | 5.303% | 404 s |
| `attempt20c_compact` | CompactChartNet + W1–W5 | **2.207%** | 6.783% | 3659 s |

**Script**: `manuscript_experiments/example2_rabbit_poisson/run_poisson_rabbit_atlas_schwarz.py`
**Best checkpoint**: `runs/attempt20c_compact/`

### Example 3: Stanford Bunny PLY Volumetric Neural SDF

**Description**: Volumetric neural signed-distance benchmark on the watertight
Stanford Bunny PLY surface. This example bridges mesh-imported geometry and the
downstream atlas/PDE pipeline by learning a differentiable volume representation.

**Domain**: Stanford Bunny PLY (`bun_zipper.ply`), normalized to a global
bounding-box frame before SDF training.

**Model**:
- neural SDF `φ_θ(y)` trained from surface samples and normals
- losses on surface consistency, normal alignment, Eikonal regularity, and sign anchors

**Canonical result** (`bunny_sdf_v3`):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| surface loss | `1.66e-2` |
| normal loss | `3.18e-2` |
| Eikonal loss | `7.29e-1` |
| sign-anchor loss | `3.11e-1` |
| Runtime | `~4800 s` (approx.) |

**Interpretation**:
- surface and normal quality are strong enough for downstream geometry use
- thin features, especially the ears, still make the sign-anchor term difficult
- this benchmark is therefore a geometry-modeling success with a clearly exposed limitation

**Script**: `core/train_sdf_rabbit.py`

---

### Example 4: Inverse Neo-Hookean Elasticity — Torus (Original Atlas)

**Description**: Controlled synthetic material-parameter identification benchmark.
The torus displacement field is prescribed, synthetic traction observations are
generated from it, and the inverse solve recovers the global shear modulus `μ`
and bulk modulus `K`.

**Domain**: Torus (major radius R=1.0, minor radius r=0.35, genus-1 topology).
Atlas: 8 coordinate charts covering the torus surface.

**Forward model** (compressible neo-Hookean):
```
P = μ(F − F⁻ᵀ) + K ln(J) F⁻ᵀ
```

**Inverse problem**: Given synthetic boundary traction observations `t_obs`,
identify scalar parameters `μ` and `K`.

**True parameters**: μ = 1.8, K = 25.0

**Method**: Controlled parameter-recovery solve. The code optimizes only `μ`
and `K`; it does **not** solve a chart-local elasticity PDE for the displacement field.

**Canonical figure run** (`torus_inverse_mps_dense_v4`):

| Parameter | True | Estimated | Rel. Error |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| μ (shear modulus) | 1.800 | 1.79973 | `1.49e-2 %` |
| K (bulk modulus) | 25.00 | 24.9948 | `2.09e-2 %` |

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| traction rel_l2 | `2.09e-4` |
| Runtime | `93.0 s` |

**Interpretation**:
- this is a clean lower-bound benchmark for the inverse machinery
- it verifies material-parameter recovery under known kinematics
- it should not be read as evidence of a full chart-local inverse elasticity field solve

**Script**: `manuscript_experiments/example3_torus_inverse_original/run_torus_inverse_neohookean_atlas.py`

---

### Example 5: Torus Elastoplastic Inverse Identification

**Two-stage constitutive parameter estimation** for finite-strain J₂ elastoplasticity with kinematic hardening on the torus geometry.

- **Scripts**: `experiments/torus_elastoplastic/`
- **Key contribution**: Smooth return mapping with softplus regularization (`η = softplus(Φ/ε)·ε`) replaces non-differentiable yield-surface check, enabling gradient-based optimization through incremental load-stepping solver
- **Stage 1**: Yield stress τ_y from monotonic displacement data → **0.25% error**
- **Stage 2**: Kinematic hardening H_kin from cyclic reaction-force data → **2.11% error**
- **Sensitivity studies**: Initial guess robustness (6 starting points), mesh refinement, epsilon annealing
- **FD comparison**: Autograd is 2.9× faster than finite differences; non-smooth (hard max) return mapping stalls
- **Figures**: `manuscript/scripts_figures/example5_torus_elastoplastic.py`

**Results**:

| Stage | Unknown | Observation | True | Identified | Error |
|-------|---------|-------------|------|------------|-------|
| 1 | τ_y | interior displacements | 0.500 | 0.4988 | 0.25% |
| 2 | H_kin | boundary reaction forces | 20.0 | 19.58 | 2.11% |

### Additional Validated and Experimental Benchmarks

These runs remain useful in the repository, but they are no longer part of the
main numbered sequence used in the manuscript.

#### Torus chart-consensus inverse benchmark

- Script: `manuscript_experiments/example4_torus_inverse_schwarz_dual/run_torus_inverse_neohookean_schwarz_dual.py`
- Purpose: multi-chart consensus benchmark with traction and displacement-style observations
- Status: promising, but the traction-mode run is cleaner than the full mixed run set, so it is treated as a secondary benchmark rather than a main-text result

#### Rabbit Elder-type inverse benchmark

- Scripts:
  - `experiments/rabbit_elder/run_rabbit_inverse_elder_atlas_schwarz.py`
  - `experiments/paraview_exporters/export_rabbit_elder_inverse_paraview.py`
- Purpose: teacher-guided inverse recovery of a rotated SPD permeability tensor on the rabbit atlas
- Status: moved to `experiments` because the inverse stabilization still needs further work before it is strong enough for the main manuscript

#### Stanford Bunny Poisson with interior pretraining

- Scripts:
  - `core/build_mesh_sdf.py`
  - `experiments/rabbit_atlas_variants/build_rabbit_atlas_volumetric.py`
  - `experiments/rabbit_atlas_variants/train_rabbit_atlas.py`
  - `experiments/rabbit_atlas_variants/run_poisson_rabbit_atlas_schwarz_experimental.py`
- Best run: `runs/bunny_poisson_8chart_intpre20k/`
- Best reported metric: `rel_l2 = 4.73%`
- Status: important downstream benchmark for thin-feature geometry, but it currently serves better as an experimental continuation of the Bunny SDF story than as a core manuscript example

## Prerequisites and Installation

### Python Version

Python ≥ 3.9 (3.10 or 3.11 recommended).

### Required Libraries

```bash
# CUDA (NVIDIA GPU):
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

pip install torch torchvision
```

| Library | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `torch` | ≥ 2.0 | Neural networks, autograd, linear algebra |
| `numpy` | ≥ 1.24 | Array operations, point cloud I/O |
| `matplotlib` | ≥ 3.7 | Convergence plots |
| `scipy` | ≥ 1.10 | (optional) Poisson-disk sampling utilities |

No mesh generation library required — the method is fully meshfree.

### Hardware

| Platform | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **NVIDIA GPU (CUDA)** | Recommended; float64 supported; `--amp` reduces memory |
| **Apple M1–M4 (MPS)** | Supported; use `--dtype float32`; some linalg ops use CPU fallback |

## Geometry Preparation Pipeline

### Stage 0: Point Cloud

```bash
# Stanford rabbit: download PLY, convert to NPZ
python - <<'EOF'
import open3d as o3d, numpy as np
mesh = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("bunny/reconstruction/bun_zipper.ply")
pcd  = mesh.sample_points_uniformly(30000)
np.savez("rabbit_pointcloud.npz",
         points=np.asarray(pcd.points),
         normals=np.asarray(pcd.normals))
EOF
```

Analytic domains (torus, ellipsoid, star) generate their own point clouds internally.

### Stage 1: Train Neural SDF

```bash
python core/train_sdf_rabbit.py \
    --point-cloud rabbit_pointcloud.npz \
    --output-dir  runs/sdf_rabbit \
    --epochs      5000  --width 128  --depth 6 \
    --lr 8e-4     --device auto  --seed 42
```

Output: `runs/sdf_rabbit/rabbit_sdf.pt`

### Stage 2: Build Atlas

```bash
python experiments/rabbit_atlas_variants/build_rabbit_atlas_volumetric.py \
    --sdf-checkpoint runs/sdf_rabbit/rabbit_sdf.pt \
    --output-dir     runs/atlas_vol \
    --n-charts       12 \
    --overlap-target 0.20 \
    --seed           42
```

Output: `runs/atlas_vol/rabbit_atlas_data.npz`, `runs/atlas_vol/rabbit_atlas_meta.json`

### Stage 3: Train Atlas Decoder

```bash
python experiments/rabbit_atlas_variants/train_rabbit_atlas.py \
    --atlas-data  runs/atlas_vol/rabbit_atlas_data.npz \
    --sdf-checkpoint runs/sdf_rabbit/rabbit_sdf.pt \
    --volumetric \
    --output-dir  runs/atlas_vol_trained \
    --epochs      3000  --width 64  --depth 4 \
    --lr 8e-4     --device auto  --seed 42
```

Output: `runs/atlas_vol_trained/rabbit_atlas_trained.pt`, `runs/atlas_vol_trained/rabbit_atlas_gate_report.json`

## Known Limitations

1. **CompactChartNet runtime**: 9× slower than dense MLP due to M=9 sub-nets in the
   double-autograd computation graph for the Laplacian. Reduce `--compact-n-subseed` to
   4–5 for a 2× speedup at some loss of expressiveness.

2. **CompactChartNet exclusive-zone fine-tuning**: With `tau_scale=0.5`, the safety margin
   is too large and all sub-nets are frozen. Requires `safety_factor ≤ 1.5` or a
   point-coverage-based masking approach to have any effect.

3. **Schwarz oscillation (dense MLP)**: After reaching the best iterate (~iter 8 for W4+W5),
   the dense MLP Schwarz oscillates at 3–6%. Hard-capping with `--max-schwarz-iters 10`
   or tighter `--plateau-patience 5` helps preserve the optimum.

4. **MPS float32 only**: Apple MPS does not reliably support float64. Inverse problems
   are run on CPU with float64 for accuracy. Forward Poisson runs on MPS with float32.

5. **TI Arruda-Boyce identifiability**: The transversely-isotropic material inverse
   problem has near-degenerate parameter directions; single traction load families may
   be insufficient for four-parameter identification.

6. **Seam artifacts in gradient fields**: The partition-of-unity blending is C⁰ but not
   C¹; gradient-based observables (Darcy velocity = −K∇p) show visible seams at chart
   boundaries. Use `weighted_detached` blending policy for visualization.

7. **Global SDF sign quality on thin-featured geometry**: The global SDF uses a single
   anchor offset across all charts.  For the Stanford Bunny (~5 mm ears), an offset large
   enough for body coverage (38.9 mm) places anchors outside the ears, causing 31% sign
   errors.  This corrupts interface normals in all 12 charts simultaneously and causes
   Schwarz iteration to diverge.  The **chart-partitioned Stanford Bunny continuation**
   addresses
   this directly via geometry-adaptive per-chart offsets (0.2–4.2 mm for the bunny).

## TODO / Open Problems

The following tasks are planned or in progress, roughly ordered by priority.

### High Priority — Stanford Bunny Poisson convergence

- [ ] **[EXP] Run `scripts/experimental/run_chartwise_sdf_example.sh`** (~5.5 h)
  Train chart-partitioned SDF on Stanford Bunny, rebuild atlas, run Poisson PINN.
  Target metric: `sign_error < 0.05` (vs current 0.311 for global SDF v3).

- [ ] **[EVAL] Verify Schwarz convergence with chartwise SDF**
  Monitor `interface_flux` per iteration — it should decrease (not increase as before).
  Record best `rel_L2` and compare to current 28.1% (iter=1 checkpoint).

- [ ] **[TUNE] If chartwise PINN still diverges**: add cross-chart consistency loss
  in overlap regions (`mean((φᵢ(x) - φⱼ(x))²)` for chart pairs sharing overlap points).
  This is already stubbed in `train_sdf_chartwise.py` as `compute_overlap_consistency`.

- [ ] **[BENCH] If chartwise PINN converges**: document results in `RESULTS.md`,
  add a row to the `scripts/successful/` table, and run postprocessing to generate
  publication figures (`paraview/bunny_poisson_chartwise/`, `figures/bunny_chartwise/`).

### Medium Priority — SDF quality improvements

- [ ] **[CODE] Normal estimation for PLY without per-vertex normals**
  The current PCA k-NN implementation uses a centroid-based global orientation flip,
  which misclassifies ~50% of normals on concave surfaces (e.g., between the ears).
  Better approach: use a minimum spanning tree (MST) propagation algorithm (Hoppe et al.)
  to propagate consistent orientation from a seed point.

- [ ] **[CODE] Multi-scale anchor offsets in global SDF**
  Train the global `SDFNet` with a mix of three offsets (e.g., 0.02, 0.15, 0.50)
  rather than a single value.  This is an alternative to the full chartwise SDF approach
  and simpler to integrate with the existing pipeline.

- [ ] **[CODE] Replace centroid-estimated normals with global SDF gradient**
  When `--sdf-checkpoint` is provided to `train_sdf_chartwise.py`, use
  `n(x) = ∇φ(x) / ‖∇φ(x)‖` at PLY surface points as the normal estimate.
  The global SDF v3 already has `final_normal = 0.032` (good gradient alignment),
  so its gradients are reliable normals even if the sign is wrong.

### Medium Priority — PINN architecture

- [ ] **[CODE] Replace manufactured solution with PLY-mesh BCs**
  Currently the Poisson PINN enforces `u=sin(πx₁)sin(πx₂)sin(πx₃)` on `∂Ω` using the
  SDF zero-crossing for BC sampling.  A wrong-sign SDF places BC samples inside Ω.
  Using the actual PLY mesh vertices as BC sample points removes the SDF-sign dependence
  for boundary conditions entirely.

- [ ] **[CODE] Supervised warmup before Schwarz iterations**
  Add a pre-Schwarz phase where all charts are initialized to the manufactured solution
  via MSE regression.  This gives a good global starting point before the Schwarz
  coupling begins, avoiding the cold-start divergence observed in the Stanford Bunny runs.

- [ ] **[EXP] CompactChartNet on Stanford Bunny**
  Once the sign quality is resolved (via chartwise SDF or PLY-mesh BCs), benchmark
  the CompactChartNet architecture on the Stanford Bunny domain.
  Hypothesis: monotone Schwarz convergence carries over from the procedural rabbit.

### Low Priority — Paper and documentation

- [ ] **[DOC] Finalize paper draft** (`docs/chatgpt52_paper_starter.md`)
  Key sections remaining: Stanford Bunny continuation results table, comparison with
  the global SDF baseline, discussion of adaptive offset derivation.

- [ ] **[DOC] Generate publication figures for Stanford Bunny**
  Once chartwise PINN converges, run `postprocessing/render_3d_figures.py` to produce:
  - `figures/3d/bunny_poisson_error_surface.png`
  - `figures/3d/bunny_poisson_charts.png`
  - `figures/3d/bunny_adaptive_offsets.png`

- [ ] **[CODE] Git push `PINN_coordinate_chart_3Dgeometry` main branch**
  The sub-repo is 7 commits ahead of `origin/main` (as of 2026-03-01).
  Push after the chartwise SDF experiment validates.

- [ ] **[CODE] Vectorize `estimate_normals_pca` in `train_sdf_chartwise.py`**
  The current per-point `np.linalg.eigh` loop is O(N·k²) and takes ~0.8s for 36k
  points.  A batched `np.linalg.eigh` on the full covariance stack would be 10–20× faster.
